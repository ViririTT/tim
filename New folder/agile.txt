 Mentoring isn’t just an activity for junior members to learn from senior members.
  Everyone on the team learns from one another so that the impact of the team as a whole is 
  greater than the sum of the impact made by its individual members. Meanwhile, shared skill 
  sets unlock the power of the team to tackle heterogeneous work. As engineers, it’s always
   important to learn new skills because it makes us more valuable to the organization and 
   better equipped to support each other’s work. 
 It also guards against someone becoming a critical path, which takes a load off everyone's mind.

 Pro tip: Agile teams aren’t just for engineers. In larger software organizations,
  agile teams form in many parts of the business: marketing, HR, finance—you name it!

  For example, a typical software team has four workflow states:
  To Do, In Progress, Code Review, and Done.

  What is the high-level business problem that you’re solving? Instead of boiling the ocean, zero in on an area of opportunity.
Who is the customer impacted by the business problem? Are you targeting your employees, customers, or partners? And within that 
audience, which specific segments?

Remember the sweet spot for HCD outlined earlier? Success is at the intersection of desirability, feasibility, and viability.
 Relationship design expands the criteria, so that products and services are made with inclusivity, sustainability, and ethics in mind.
